# Parking Control API

This API was developed in a quick Spring Boot course led by instructor Michelli Brito. In the course, we built a Spring Boot project (Parking Control API) from scratch, incorporating technologies such as:
- Spring MVC
- Spring Data JPA
- Spring Validation.

We created an API with features including Pageable, getAll, getOne, post, delete, update, and Global Custom methods.
